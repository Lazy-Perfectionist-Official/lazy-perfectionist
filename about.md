# About Lazy Perfectionist

**Artist**: Sammy  
**Project**: Lazy Perfectionist  
**Last Updated**: October 28, 2025

Lazy Perfectionist is an instrumental progressive rock/metal project blending technical precision, emotional storytelling, orchestral layers, EDM-inspired synths, and anime music influences.

The debut single *Orbit* (released October 17, 2025) anchors a four-track EP — a "sound walk" exploring human contradictions.

**Core Beliefs**:  
- Flaws are the heartbeat  
- Instrumental music is universal story  
- Perspective transforms via "sound walks"  
- Commit when it captures intent

**What Makes It Different**:  
Self-taught HK business student blending solfa instinct, orchestral clouds, and raw duality into unique "sound walks." Bedroom DIY ethos — from AirPods mixing to pro studio drums.

**Enemies**: Perfectionism paralysis, self-doubt before release.
