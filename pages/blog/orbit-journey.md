# From Assignment to Release: The Making of "Orbit"

## The Beginning

It started as a simple university assignment â€” create a piece of music that represents a personal journey. I never expected it would become my debut single.

## Concept Development

I wanted to capture the feeling of the "overview effect" â€” that cognitive shift astronauts experience when seeing Earth from space. Suddenly, all our problems and contradictions seem small and manageable.

### Musical Elements

**Progressive Structure**: The track follows a non-traditional song structure, evolving through different sections rather than following verse-chorus patterns.

**Orchestral Layers**: I layered multiple synth pads to create that "space" feeling â€” wide, expansive, and slightly mysterious.

**Rhythmic Complexity**: The drums shift between 4/4 and 7/8 time signatures, representing the tension between order and chaos.

## Production Process

### Phase 1: Basic Composition
- Started with simple piano melody
- Developed chord progression in D minor
- Created basic drum pattern

### Phase 2: Layer Building
- Added bass guitar with progressive metal influence
- Layered orchestral strings using software instruments
- Incorporated EDM-inspired synth elements

### Phase 3: Recording
- **Guitars**: Recorded at home using interface and amp simulation
- **Drums**: Professional studio recording for authentic sound
- **Mixing**: Started in Logic Pro, finished with professional mixing

### Phase 4: The Struggle
This is where the "lazy perfectionist" theme really came alive. I spent weeks tweaking small details:

- EQ adjustments that made no perceptible difference
- Reverb settings that I changed daily
- Compression settings that I obsessed over

The breakthrough came when I accepted that "good enough" was actually perfect for the emotional message.

## Technical Details

**Software Used**:
- Logic Pro X for arrangement and mixing
- Superior Drummer 3 for drum programming
- Omnisphere for orchestral elements
- Neural DSP plugins for guitar processing

**Equipment**:
- Fender Stratocaster (modified)
- Audio Interface: Focusrite Scarlett 2i2
- Monitors: Yamaha HS5
- Headphones: Audio-Technica ATH-M50x

## The "Sound Walk" Concept

"Orbit" is meant to be a journey through different emotional states:

1. **Launch (0:00-1:15)**: Building tension, representing ambition
2. **Space (1:15-2:30)**: Floating, peaceful section â€” the overview effect
3. **Return (2:30-3:30)**: Coming back to reality with new perspective
4. **Resolution (3:30-4:32)**: Acceptance and integration

## Lessons Learned

### Technical Skills
- Improved mixing techniques significantly
- Learned orchestral arrangement basics
- Mastered complex time signature changes

### Personal Growth
- Overcame perfectionism paralysis
- Learned to trust my instincts
- Understood that emotion matters more than technical perfection

### Industry Insights
- Importance of professional networking
- Value of good mastering
- Power of authentic storytelling

## Release Strategy

I decided to release "Orbit" independently to maintain creative control:

1. **YouTube Release**: Primary platform for visual storytelling
2. **Social Media Campaign**: Behind-the-scenes content
3. **Blog Series**: Detailed production insights
4. **EP Development**: Using "Orbit" as foundation for larger project

## What's Next

"Orbit" is just the beginning. I'm currently working on three more tracks that complete the EP narrative:

- **Dichotomy**: Exploring technical vs. emotional expression
- **Paralysis**: The creative struggle
- **Release**: Artistic freedom and acceptance

Each track will build on lessons learned from making "Orbit" â€” but with more confidence and less perfectionism.

## Advice for Other Artists

If you're struggling with perfectionism:

1. **Set deadlines**: Even artificial ones help
2. **Trust your gut**: Your first instinct is often right
3. **Get feedback**: Outside perspective breaks the obsession loop
4. **Embrace flaws**: They make your art unique
